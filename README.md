# Clustering of MIGHTEE data

#### Status:Done

## Description
   
Welcome to the MIGHTEE hackathon project! This project includes the following tutorials:

- *Tutorial 1* : Data Exploration
- *Tutorial 2* : Clustering


## Data

The MIGHTEE dataset is used for these tutorials. It contains 2824 data points, where a data point belongs to either a [star forming galaxies](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/understanding-star-forming-galaxies) "SFGs" or [active galactic nuclei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus) "AGN".


## Hackathon Task
After completing the tutorials, teams will be asked to present the best machine learning clustering model that distinguishes between SFGs and AGN. Note that this problem is an unsupervised learning challenge, meaning teams will need to rely on algorithms that do not require labeled data for model training. Few examples can be found [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html).  However, a labeled validation set is be provided to validate the performance of the clustering models.

### New to Github?

The easiest way to get all of the lecture and tutorial material is to clone this repository. To do this you need git installed on your laptop. If you're working on Linux you can install git using apt-get (you might need to use sudo):

```
apt install git
```

You can then clone the repository by typing:
